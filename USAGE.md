# Ruby Routes - Possible Usage Scenarios

Ruby Routes is a flexible, high-performance routing library that can be used in various contexts beyond traditional web frameworks. Here are the key usage scenarios:

## üåê **Web Applications & APIs**

### **1. Lightweight Web Services**

```ruby
# Microservice with custom routing
require 'ruby_routes'
require 'rack'

router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  get '/health', to: 'health#check'
  get '/api/v1/users/:id', as: :user, to: 'users#show'
  post '/api/v1/users', as: :create_user, to: 'users#create'
  
  namespace :admin do
    resources :users
    resources :analytics
  end
end

# Generate URLs programmatically
user_path = router.route_set.generate_path(:user, id: 123)  # => "/api/v1/users/123"
create_user_path = router.route_set.generate_path(:create_user)  # => "/api/v1/users"

# Rack application
class MyApp
  def initialize(router)
    @router = router
  end
  
  def call(env)
    route = @router.route_set.match(env['REQUEST_METHOD'], env['PATH_INFO'])
    # Handle routing logic
  end
end
```

### **2. API Gateways**

```ruby
# Route requests to different microservices
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  scope path: '/api/v1' do
    get '/users/*path', to: 'proxy#users_service'
    get '/orders/*path', to: 'proxy#orders_service'
    get '/payments/*path', to: 'proxy#payments_service'
  end
  
  # Rate limiting routes (rate limiting logic would be implemented in the proxy handler)
  get '/public/*path', to: 'proxy#public_api'
  get '/premium/*path', to: 'proxy#premium_api'
end
```

### **3. Custom Web Frameworks**

```ruby
# Build your own web framework
class MyFramework
  def initialize(&block)
    @router = RubyRoutes.draw(&block)
  end
  
  def call(env)
    route_info = @router.route_set.match(env['REQUEST_METHOD'], env['PATH_INFO'])
    return [404, {}, ['Not Found']] unless route_info
    
    controller_class = Object.const_get("#{route_info[:controller].capitalize}Controller")
    controller = controller_class.new
    response = controller.send(route_info[:action], route_info[:params])
    
    [200, {'Content-Type' => 'application/json'}, [response.to_json]]
  end
end

# Usage
app = MyFramework.new do
  resources :users
  resources :posts
end
```

## üîß **Non-Web Applications**

### **4. CLI Command Routing**

```ruby
# Route CLI commands to handlers
class CLIRouter
  def initialize
    @router = RubyRoutes.draw do
      get '/user/create', to: 'user#create'
      get '/user/list', to: 'user#list'
      get '/user/:id/show', to: 'user#show'
      get '/deploy/:environment', to: 'deploy#execute'
      get '/config/set/:key/:value', to: 'config#set'
    end
  end
  
  def route_command(command_parts)
    path = "/#{command_parts.join('/')}"
    route = @router.route_set.match('GET', path)
    
    if route
      handler_class = Object.const_get("#{route[:controller].capitalize}Handler")
      handler_class.new.send(route[:action], route[:params])
    else
      puts "Unknown command: #{command_parts.join(' ')}"
    end
  end
end

# Usage: ruby cli.rb user create --name John
cli = CLIRouter.new
cli.route_command(ARGV)
```

### **5. Message/Event Routing**

```ruby
# Route messages based on patterns
class MessageRouter
  def initialize
    @router = RubyRoutes.draw do
      get '/events/user/:action', to: 'user_events#handle'
      get '/events/order/:status', to: 'order_events#handle'
      get '/notifications/:type/:priority', to: 'notifications#send'
      get '/webhooks/:service/:event', to: 'webhooks#process'
    end
  end
  
  def route_message(message_type, data)
    route = @router.route_set.match('GET', "/#{message_type}")
    return unless route
    
    handler_class = Object.const_get("#{route[:controller].capitalize}")
    handler_class.new.send(route[:action], route[:params].merge(data))
  end
end

# Usage
router = MessageRouter.new
router.route_message('events/user/login', { user_id: 123, ip: '192.168.1.1' })
router.route_message('notifications/email/high', { recipient: 'admin@example.com' })
```

### **6. File/Resource Routing**

```ruby
# Route file operations based on patterns
class FileRouter
  def initialize
    @router = RubyRoutes.draw do
      get '/images/:size/:filename', to: 'images#resize'
      get '/documents/:type/:id', to: 'documents#serve'
      get '/cache/:namespace/:key', to: 'cache#get'
      post '/uploads/:category', to: 'uploads#store'
    end
  end
  
  def route_file_request(path)
    route = @router.route_set.match('GET', path)
    return nil unless route
    
    processor_class = Object.const_get("#{route[:controller].capitalize}Processor")
    processor_class.new.send(route[:action], route[:params])
  end
end

# Usage
router = FileRouter.new
router.route_file_request('/images/thumbnail/photo.jpg')
router.route_file_request('/documents/pdf/invoice-123')
```

- **Secure constraints** - Type-safe constraint system without code execution

### **Flexibility:**

- **Pattern matching** - Complex routing patterns
- **Constraint system** - Validate parameters before processing
