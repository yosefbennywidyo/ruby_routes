- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, fast performance

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby_routes'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install ruby_routes
```

## Basic Usage

### Simple Routes

```ruby
require 'ruby_routes'

router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  get '/', to: 'home#index'
  get '/about', to: 'pages#about'
  post '/users', to: 'users#create'
  put '/users/:id', to: 'users#update'
  delete '/users/:id', to: 'users#destroy'
end
```

### RESTful Resources

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  resources :users
  resources :posts
  resources :comments
end
```

This creates the following routes:
- `GET /users` ‚Üí `users#index`
- `GET /users/new` ‚Üí `users#new`
- `POST /users` ‚Üí `users#create`
- `GET /users/:id` ‚Üí `users#show`
- `GET /users/:id/edit` ‚Üí `users#edit`
- `PUT /users/:id` ‚Üí `users#update`
- `PATCH /users/:id` ‚Üí `users#update`
- `DELETE /users/:id` ‚Üí `users#destroy`

### Named Routes

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  get '/users', as: :users, to: 'users#index'
  get '/users/:id', as: :user, to: 'users#show'
  post '/users', as: :create_user, to: 'users#create'
end

# Generate paths
router.route_set.generate_path(:users)           # => "/users"
router.route_set.generate_path(:user, id: '123') # => "/users/123"
```

### Namespaces

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  namespace :admin do
    resources :users
    resources :posts
  end
end

# Creates routes like:
# GET /admin/users ‚Üí admin/users#index
# GET /admin/users/:id ‚Üí admin/users#show
# etc.
```

### Nested Resources

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  resources :categories do
    resources :products
  end
end

# Creates routes like:
# GET /categories/:category_id/products ‚Üí products#index
# GET /categories/:category_id/products/:id ‚Üí products#show
# etc.
```

### Route Constraints

Ruby Routes provides a powerful and secure constraint system to validate route parameters. **For security reasons, Proc constraints are deprecated** - use the secure alternatives below.

#### Built-in Constraint Types

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  # Integer validation
  get '/users/:id', to: 'users#show', constraints: { id: :int }
  
  # UUID validation
  get '/resources/:uuid', to: 'resources#show', constraints: { uuid: :uuid }
  
  # Email validation
  get '/users/:email', to: 'users#show', constraints: { email: :email }
  
  # URL-friendly slug validation
  get '/posts/:slug', to: 'posts#show', constraints: { slug: :slug }
  
  # Alphabetic characters only
  get '/categories/:name', to: 'categories#show', constraints: { name: :alpha }
  
  # Alphanumeric characters only
  get '/codes/:code', to: 'codes#show', constraints: { code: :alphanumeric }
end
```

#### Hash-based Constraints (Recommended)

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  # Length constraints
  get '/users/:username', to: 'users#show',
      constraints: { 
        username: { 
          min_length: 3, 
          max_length: 20,
          format: /\A[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\z/
        } 
      }

  # Allowed values (whitelist)
  get '/posts/:status', to: 'posts#show',
      constraints: { 
        status: { in: %w[draft published archived] }
      }

  # Numeric ranges
  get '/products/:price', to: 'products#show',
      constraints: { 
        price: { range: 1..10000 }
      }
end
```

#### Regular Expression Constraints

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  # Custom regex pattern (with ReDoS protection)
  get '/products/:sku', to: 'products#show', 
      constraints: { sku: /\A[A-Z]{2}\d{4}\z/ }
end
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice: Proc Constraints Deprecated

```ruby
# ‚ùå DEPRECATED - Security risk!
get '/users/:id', to: 'users#show',
    constraints: { id: ->(value) { value.to_i > 0 } }

# ‚úÖ Use secure alternatives instead:
get '/users/:id', to: 'users#show',
    constraints: { id: { range: 1..Float::INFINITY } }
```

### Scopes

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  scope defaults: { format: 'html' } do
    get '/posts', to: 'posts#index'
  end
end
```

### Concerns

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  concern :commentable do
    resources :comments
  end
  
  resources :posts do
    concerns :commentable
  end
  
  resources :articles do
    concerns :commentable
  end
end
```

### Root Route

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  root to: 'home#index'
end
```

## Route Matching

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  get '/users/:id', to: 'users#show'
  post '/users', to: 'users#create'
end

# Match a request
result = router.route_set.match('GET', '/users/123')
if result
  puts "Controller: #{result[:controller]}"
  puts "Action: #{result[:action]}"
  puts "Params: #{result[:params]}"
  # => Controller: users
  # => Action: show
  # => Params: {"id"=>"123"}
end
```

## Path Generation

```ruby
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  get '/users/:id', as: :user, to: 'users#show'
  get '/posts/:id/comments/:comment_id', as: :post_comment, to: 'comments#show'
end

# Generate paths
router.route_set.generate_path(:user, id: '123')
# => "/users/123"

router.route_set.generate_path(:post_comment, id: '456', comment_id: '789')
# => "/posts/456/comments/789"
```

## Integration with Rack

```ruby
require 'rack'
require 'ruby_routes'

# Define routes
router = RubyRoutes.draw do
  get '/', to: 'home#index'
  get '/users', to: 'users#index'
  get '/users/:id', to: 'users#show'
end

# Create Rack app
class RubyRoutesApp
  def initialize(router)
    @router = router
  end
  
  def call(env)
    request_method = env['REQUEST_METHOD']
    request_path = env['PATH_INFO']
    
    route_info = @router.route_set.match(request_method, request_path)
    
    if route_info
      # Handle the request
      controller = route_info[:controller]
      action = route_info[:action]
      params = route_info[:params]
      
      # Your controller logic here
      [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/html'}, ["Hello from #{controller}##{action}"]]
    else
      [404, {'Content-Type' => 'text/html'}, ['Not Found']]
    end
  end
end

# Run the app
app = RubyRoutesApp.new(router)
Rack::Handler::WEBrick.run app, Port: 9292
```

## Security

Ruby Routes prioritizes security and has implemented several protections:

### üîí Security Features
- **XSS Protection**: All HTML output is properly escaped
- **ReDoS Protection**: Regular expression constraints have timeout protection
- **Secure Constraints**: Deprecated dangerous Proc constraints in favor of secure alternatives
- **Thread Safety**: All caching and shared resources are thread-safe
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation before reaching application code

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice
**Proc constraints are deprecated due to security risks** and will be removed in a future version. They allow arbitrary code execution which can be exploited for:
- Code injection attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- System compromise

**Migration Required**: If you're using Proc constraints, please migrate to secure alternatives using our [Migration Guide](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

The test suite includes comprehensive security tests to ensure all protections are working correctly.
