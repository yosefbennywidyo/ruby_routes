  class Router
    # Builder
    #
    # Records routing DSL invocations without mutating a live Router.
    # Later, `#build` replays the recorded calls on a fresh Router,
    # finalizes it (immutability), and returns the frozen instance.
    #
    # Benefits:
    # - Decouples route declaration time from Router instantiation.
    # - Enables reuse (same blueprint -> multiple routers).
    # - Safe to construct on boot and share across threads after build.
    #
    # Usage:
    #   builder = RubyRoutes::Router::Builder.new do
    #     namespace :api do
    #       resources :users
    #     end
    #     get '/health', to: 'system#health'
    #   end
    #   router = builder.build  # finalized (router.frozen? == true)
    #
    # Supported DSL methods are mirrored here. Blocks are stored as Procs;
    # serialization of blocks is not supported.
